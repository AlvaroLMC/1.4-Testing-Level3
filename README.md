# üß™ Level 3: TDD - Calculator

## üìå Description

This exercise aims to practice Test Driven Development (TDD). We will create a class named `Calculator` that implements basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The TDD approach will be followed by writing tests before implementing the functionality.

### Steps of the exercise:

1. Create a test class named `CalculatorTest`.
2. Write tests to verify the methods: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`.
3. Run the tests (they will fail since the class is not implemented yet).
4. Create the `Calculator` class with the corresponding methods.
5. Run the tests again (they should pass).
6. Repeat the TDD process: rewrite, refactor, and extend functionality as needed.
